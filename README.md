**Image Locker** is a browser-based tool for encrypting and decrypting images or JSON files using password-based AES-GCM encryption. All operations are performed locally in your browser, ensuring privacy and security without uploading files to any server.

## Features

- **Encrypt images or JSON files** with a password using AES-GCM.
- **Decrypt encrypted JSON files** back to images.
- **Drag-and-drop interface** for easy file selection.
- **Password visibility toggle** and minimum password length enforcement.
- **Download encrypted files** as JSON for secure sharing or storage.
- **Theme toggle** for light/dark mode.
